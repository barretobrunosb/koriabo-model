## Abstract

Between AD 1000 and 1500, the Koriabo Tradition expanded extensively, spanning the Guianas and the lower Amazon, persisting into the 16th and 17th centuries in the Caribbean and select Amazon areas. Notably, despite its wide distribution, Koriabo ceramics displayed remarkable consistency in motifs and some vessel shapes. This paper combines radiocarbon and linguistic models to explore a dual-process hypothesis of Koriabo expansion, marked by cultural transmission and demic diffusion closely linked to the dispersals of Cariban languages. We suggest this interplay facilitated rapid dissemination and established partially uniform archaeological patterns across the landscape.
